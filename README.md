## About
Graduate from the University of Bangor with an upper second class honours degree in Sociology (BA). I am a highly focused and determined individual with proven leadership skills and achievements in numerous extra-curricular activities. I have recently graduated from Makers Academy bootcamp, where I have developed experienced programming skills in Ruby & Javascript along with using various other frameworks & languages (Python, Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Jasmine, Capybara, Heroku

## Projects
| Title | Description | Technologies Used | Testing Frameworks & Linters |
|--|--|--|--|
| [Movie_Rating](https://github.com/Harrison25000/Movie_Rating) | I am particularly proud of this side project of mine. Programmed in JavaScript (with use of JQuery & NodeJS) and deployed on the heroku web servers (https://harrison-movie-ratings.herokuapp.com/). It uses the OMDB API to query information from the International Movie DataBase (IMDB), Metacritic & Rotten Tomatoes platforms. The app displays scores from each platform for each film or tv show searched for, and then averages the three scores to provide an overall ‘Harrison Score’. | JavaScript, JQuery, NodeJS, Heroku | - |
| [DOSA_dontworrybehappy](https://github.com/Harrison25000/DOSA_dontworrybehappy) | For our final group project at Makers Academy, my team of four decided to make a machine learning app in python, using modelled recognition of facial images to identify emotions. We trained the model on 60,000 images (mixing animated & human faces) using a complex convolutional neural network. We then displayed it through a library (​opencv2​ - CascadeClassifier - detectMultiScale) which ran facial recognition through our webcams. | Python, Jupyter Notebook, Keras, Tensorflow, Opencv2 | Manual Testing System |
| [Instagram_challenge](https://github.com/Harrison25000/instagram-challenge) | This challenge required initiative to go and find appropriate applications that would enable you to store images within a database. This led me to 'Paperclip', a gem for Ruby, intended as an easy file attachment library for ActiveRecord. This then allowed me to pass an image through a form, adding a title and description, and then to could be viewed on an additional page alongside all the other images submitted. | Ruby on Rails, Paperclip, SQL, Capybara, ActiveRecord | RSpec, Rubocop |
